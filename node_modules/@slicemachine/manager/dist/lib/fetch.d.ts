 * Patched `fetch()` from `node-fetch` that fixes a bug where quick consecutive
 * network requests cause failed requests.
 *
 * Use this `fetch()` in place of `node-fetch`'s `fetch()`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `fetch()` is patched by setting an HTTP/HTTPS Agent with `keepAlive: true`.
 * If you need to assign an Agent, be sure to retain the `keepAlive: true`
 * option.
